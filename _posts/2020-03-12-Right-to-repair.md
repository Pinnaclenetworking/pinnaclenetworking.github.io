<h2>We have a right to:</h2>
Fix our own things or choose which service shop to use.

Manuals and diagnostic tools the dealers use

Would you buy a car if it was illegal to replace the tires? What if you had a bike and the chain broke, what if you couldnt fix the chain? 

<h2>People don’t have the information they need to buy quality products.</h2>
Many companies want to make quality products, and people want to buy stuff that lasts. But some greedy manufacturers build in planned obsolescence, forcing us to buy new products. To make matters worse, some short-sighted companies sabotage local repair shops by making repair manuals secret.
